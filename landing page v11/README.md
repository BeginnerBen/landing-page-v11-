* I had to add jQUery as it was neessacry for my javascript code that was given 
  to me from my mentor i have includeed the file library in jQuery folder
  
* the surfing images is located in the image folder

* all the html files apart form the index have been included in the 
  html folder 

* the javascript file is where most of the fun happens 
	--> Ive created 5 sections and linked strings to them 
	--> Ive also created a footer which i link strings to aswell
	--> The navagation bar up the top has also been created using a linked html string 

* usage 
	--> clicking on the nav  bar takes you to the relevant section on the index page  
 

* scroll behavior has been added to smoothen index html page scolling 
* dependencies 
	--> could the mentor please explains what this means in content of the project ???
